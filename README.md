# Structural-health-monitoring-for-dynamic-bodies-using-their-vibration-signals
This project focuses on fault detection and condition monitoring of dynamic structures (such as machinery, bridges, vehicles, or rotating equipment) using their vibration signals. The idea is to automatically distinguish between healthy (normal) and faulty (failure) states of a system by analyzing the patterns hidden in vibration data.

Techniques used: 
 1. EMPIRICAL DATA DECOMPOSITION
 2.
